The mention of 'red blood cells' is central to the discussion, so 'Passing mention only' is *not* met. I cannot determine 'Full text unavailable', 'Duplicate publication', or 'Non-peer-reviewed or preprint' from the title and abstract. However, the abstract does not mention liposomes or their interaction with red blood cells, so 'No liposome-RBC interaction implications' *is* met.",

        "Next, I assessed inclusion criteria. The title and abstract are entirely in English, so 'English language' *is* met. The abstract discusses cell surface engineering for 'red blood cells', implying potential effects on their properties, so 'Effects on RBC properties/function' *is* met. The abstract does not mention liposomes or their interaction with red blood cells, so 'Liposome-RBC interaction' is *not* met. The abstract is described as a 'review', so 'Relevant study type' *is* met. The abstract does not discuss liposome properties or properties related to interactions with RBCs, so 'Liposome/RBC properties with interaction implications' is *not* met. The abstract does not mention applications involving liposome-RBC interactions, so 'Applications of liposome-RBC interactions' is *not* met. The abstract is a review, not a theoretical or computational study, so 'Theoretical/computational study' is *not* met.",

        "Finally, I applied the decision logic. Since an exclusion criterion ('No liposome-RBC interaction implications') was met, the final decision is 'exclude' according to step 1 of the decision logic."
