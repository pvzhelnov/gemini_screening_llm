TI  - Regulatory Framework for Emergency Drug Importation: Lessons from the Oncology Medicine Crisis in Australia.
AB  - Context: Between 2021 and 2022, Australia experienced severe shortages of critical oncology medications, prompting emergency regulatory measures to facilitate drug importation from overseas suppliers. This crisis highlighted gaps in existing pharmaceutical supply chain regulations., Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of emergency drug importation procedures and propose improvements to regulatory frameworks for managing future medicine shortages., Design: Policy analysis combined with stakeholder interviews from regulatory agencies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies. Document analysis of emergency approvals and importation records was conducted., Participants: Interviews were conducted with 67 stakeholders including hospital pharmacists, oncologists, regulatory officials, and pharmaceutical industry representatives., Main Outcomes: Emergency importation procedures enabled access to 23 critical oncology medications during the crisis period. However, the process revealed significant bureaucratic delays, with average approval times of 14 days for emergency applications. Quality assurance protocols for imported medications required standardization, and communication between regulatory bodies and healthcare providers needed improvement., Results: Emergency importation programs successfully maintained patient access to essential cancer treatments during the crisis. Survival analysis showed no significant differences in patient outcomes between standard and imported medications. However, the ad-hoc nature of emergency procedures created uncertainty for healthcare providers and patients., Conclusions: Proactive regulatory frameworks for emergency drug importation can effectively mitigate medicine shortage impacts. Australia should establish pre-approved pathways for critical medication importation and strengthen international regulatory harmonization to prevent future crises.
