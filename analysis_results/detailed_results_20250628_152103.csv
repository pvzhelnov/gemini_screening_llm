dummy_shortages_irrelevant.ris,2,Regulatory Framework for Emergency Drug Importation: Lessons from the Oncology Medicine Crisis in Australia.,"Context: Between 2021 and 2022, Australia experienced severe shortages of critical oncology medications, prompting emergency regulatory measures to facilitate drug importation from overseas suppliers. This crisis highlighted gaps in existing pharmaceutical supply chain regulations., Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of emergency drug importation procedures and propose improvements to regulatory frameworks for managing future medicine shortages., Design: Policy analysis combined with stakeholder interviews from regulatory agencies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies. Document analysis of emergency approvals and importation records was conducted., Participants: Interviews were conducted with 67 stakeholders including hospital pharmacists, oncologists, regulatory officials, and pharmaceutical industry representatives., Main Outcomes: Emergency importation procedures enabled access to 23 critical oncology medications during the crisis period. However, the process revealed significant bureaucratic delays, with average approval times of 14 days for emergency applications. Quality assurance protocols for imported medications required standardization, and communication between regulatory bodies and healthcare providers needed improvement., Results: Emergency importation programs successfully maintained patient access to essential cancer treatments during the crisis. Survival analysis showed no significant differences in patient outcomes between standard and imported medications. However, the ad-hoc nature of emergency procedures created uncertainty for healthcare providers and patients., Conclusions: Proactive regulatory frameworks for emergency drug importation can effectively mitigate medicine shortage impacts. Australia should establish pre-approved pathways for critical medication importation and strengthen international regulatory harmonization to prevent future crises.",irrelevant,Exclude,Include,False,Yes,Yes,Yes,Maybe/Unclear,"Based on the flow logic, this study should be included because it meets the criteria for questions 1, 2, and 3, and question 4 is 'Maybe/Unclear'."
dummy_shortages_relevant.ris,0,Impact of Insulin Shortage on Diabetes Management and Glycemic Control in Type 1 Diabetic Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the global insulin shortage on diabetes management patterns and glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 12,456 type 1 diabetic patients from 187 endocrinology clinics across North America between January 2022 and December 2023. The insulin shortage period was defined from March 2023 to September 2023. Primary outcomes included HbA1c levels, frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis episodes, and insulin dosing patterns. Secondary outcomes included emergency department visits and hospitalization rates., RESULTS: During the shortage period, 67.8% of patients experienced changes in their insulin regimen. Mean HbA1c levels increased from 7.2% (95% CI 7.1-7.3) pre-shortage to 8.1% (95% CI 7.9-8.3) during shortage (p<0.001). Diabetic ketoacidosis episodes increased by 45% compared to pre-shortage rates. Alternative insulin formulations were used in 78% of affected patients, with 34% requiring dose adjustments. Geographic variation in shortage impact ranged from 23% to 89% across different regions., CONCLUSION: The insulin shortage significantly impacted glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients, leading to increased complications and healthcare utilization. Robust shortage mitigation strategies are essential for maintaining diabetes care quality.

dummy_shortages_relevant.ris,2,Antibiotic Resistance Patterns During Amoxicillin Shortage: A National Surveillance Study.,"Introduction: The widespread amoxicillin shortage in 2023 forced clinicians to use alternative antibiotics, potentially impacting resistance patterns. This study examines changes in antibiotic prescribing and resistance during the shortage period. Objectives: The primary objective was to assess changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns and antimicrobial resistance rates during the amoxicillin shortage. Secondary objectives included evaluation of clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. Methods: This national surveillance study analyzed antibiotic prescribing data from 892 healthcare facilities across the United States from January 2022 to December 2023. Resistance patterns were assessed using National Healthcare Safety Network data. Clinical outcomes and costs were compared between shortage and non-shortage periods. Results: During the amoxicillin shortage, prescriptions for alternative antibiotics increased: azithromycin (+67%), cephalexin (+89%), and clindamycin (+43%). Resistance rates to azithromycin in Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 12.4% to 19.7% (p=0.003). Healthcare costs increased by an average of $340 per patient due to more expensive alternative therapies. Treatment failure rates increased from 4.2% to 7.8% for respiratory tract infections (p<0.001). Length of stay for hospitalized patients increased by 1.3 days on average. Conclusion: The amoxicillin shortage led to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, contributing to rising resistance rates and increased healthcare costs. Strategic antibiotic stewardship during shortages is essential to minimize long-term resistance implications.
