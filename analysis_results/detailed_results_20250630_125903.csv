dummy_shortages_irrelevant.ris,0,Impact of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Essential Medicine Availability in European Hospitals.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical supply chains, particularly affecting essential medicine availability in hospital settings across Europe. Objective: To assess the impact of supply chain disruptions on medicine availability and identify factors contributing to stockout events in European hospitals during 2020-2022., Methods: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted across 45 hospitals in 12 European countries. Data on medicine stockouts, procurement delays, and alternative sourcing strategies were collected from hospital pharmacy databases. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and regression modeling to identify predictors of stockout events., Results: A total of 2,847 stockout events were documented across participating hospitals, affecting 892 unique medicines. Critical care medications showed the highest vulnerability with 34% experiencing stockouts lasting more than 7 days. Hospitals with diversified supplier networks showed 28% fewer stockout events compared to those relying on single suppliers. The implementation of strategic reserves reduced stockout duration by an average of 3.2 days., Conclusions: Supply chain diversification and strategic stockpiling significantly improve medicine availability during crisis periods. European hospitals should strengthen procurement resilience through multi-supplier strategies and enhanced inventory management systems.",irrelevant,Exclude,Exclude,True,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"Based on the flow logic, this study should be excluded because question 4 was answered with ""No""."
dummy_shortages_irrelevant.ris,1,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Predictive Models for Pharmaceutical Inventory Management in Community Pharmacies.,"Introduction: Traditional inventory management in community pharmacies relies on historical consumption patterns, often resulting in overstocking or stockouts. This study evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in optimizing pharmaceutical inventory levels., Methodology: We implemented AI-driven predictive models in 127 community pharmacies across three metropolitan areas over 18 months. The system incorporated real-time prescription data, seasonal variations, and local health trends to forecast demand. Primary outcomes included inventory turnover rates, stockout frequency, and expired medication waste., Findings: Pharmacies using AI-driven inventory management showed a 42% reduction in stockout events and 31% decrease in expired medication waste. Inventory turnover improved by 25%, while maintaining 98.7% prescription fill rates. The system demonstrated particular effectiveness for chronic disease medications, with diabetes and cardiovascular drugs showing the most significant improvements in availability., Discussion: AI-powered inventory management represents a paradigm shift in pharmaceutical logistics. The integration of predictive analytics with traditional pharmacy operations enables proactive rather than reactive inventory decisions. Implementation challenges included staff training and initial system calibration, but benefits emerged within 6 months of deployment., Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms significantly enhance pharmaceutical inventory optimization in community pharmacy settings, improving patient access while reducing waste and operational costs.",irrelevant,Exclude,Exclude,True,Yes,Yes,Maybe/Unclear,No,"Based on the flow logic, this study should be excluded because it does not examine the impact on drug utilization and access."
dummy_shortages_irrelevant.ris,2,Regulatory Framework for Emergency Drug Importation: Lessons from the Oncology Medicine Crisis in Australia.,"Context: Between 2021 and 2022, Australia experienced severe shortages of critical oncology medications, prompting emergency regulatory measures to facilitate drug importation from overseas suppliers. This crisis highlighted gaps in existing pharmaceutical supply chain regulations., Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of emergency drug importation procedures and propose improvements to regulatory frameworks for managing future medicine shortages., Design: Policy analysis combined with stakeholder interviews from regulatory agencies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies. Document analysis of emergency approvals and importation records was conducted., Participants: Interviews were conducted with 67 stakeholders including hospital pharmacists, oncologists, regulatory officials, and pharmaceutical industry representatives., Main Outcomes: Emergency importation procedures enabled access to 23 critical oncology medications during the crisis period. However, the process revealed significant bureaucratic delays, with average approval times of 14 days for emergency applications. Quality assurance protocols for imported medications required standardization, and communication between regulatory bodies and healthcare providers needed improvement., Results: Emergency importation programs successfully maintained patient access to essential cancer treatments during the crisis. Survival analysis showed no significant differences in patient outcomes between standard and imported medications. However, the ad-hoc nature of emergency procedures created uncertainty for healthcare providers and patients., Conclusions: Proactive regulatory frameworks for emergency drug importation can effectively mitigate medicine shortage impacts. Australia should establish pre-approved pathways for critical medication importation and strengthen international regulatory harmonization to prevent future crises.",irrelevant,Exclude,Include,False,Yes,Yes,Yes,Maybe/Unclear,"Based on the flow logic, this study should be included because the responses to questions 1, 2, and 3 are 'Yes' and the response to question 4 is 'Maybe/Unclear'."
