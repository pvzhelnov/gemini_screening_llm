TI  - Impact of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Essential Medicine Availability in European Hospitals.
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical supply chains, particularly affecting essential medicine availability in hospital settings across Europe. Objective: To assess the impact of supply chain disruptions on medicine availability and identify factors contributing to stockout events in European hospitals during 2020-2022., Methods: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted across 45 hospitals in 12 European countries. Data on medicine stockouts, procurement delays, and alternative sourcing strategies were collected from hospital pharmacy databases. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and regression modeling to identify predictors of stockout events., Results: A total of 2,847 stockout events were documented across participating hospitals, affecting 892 unique medicines. Critical care medications showed the highest vulnerability with 34% experiencing stockouts lasting more than 7 days. Hospitals with diversified supplier networks showed 28% fewer stockout events compared to those relying on single suppliers. The implementation of strategic reserves reduced stockout duration by an average of 3.2 days., Conclusions: Supply chain diversification and strategic stockpiling significantly improve medicine availability during crisis periods. European hospitals should strengthen procurement resilience through multi-supplier strategies and enhanced inventory management systems.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Driven Predictive Models for Pharmaceutical Inventory Management in Community Pharmacies.
AB  - Introduction: Traditional inventory management in community pharmacies relies on historical consumption patterns, often resulting in overstocking or stockouts. This study evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in optimizing pharmaceutical inventory levels., Methodology: We implemented AI-driven predictive models in 127 community pharmacies across three metropolitan areas over 18 months. The system incorporated real-time prescription data, seasonal variations, and local health trends to forecast demand. Primary outcomes included inventory turnover rates, stockout frequency, and expired medication waste., Findings: Pharmacies using AI-driven inventory management showed a 42% reduction in stockout events and 31% decrease in expired medication waste. Inventory turnover improved by 25%, while maintaining 98.7% prescription fill rates. The system demonstrated particular effectiveness for chronic disease medications, with diabetes and cardiovascular drugs showing the most significant improvements in availability., Discussion: AI-powered inventory management represents a paradigm shift in pharmaceutical logistics. The integration of predictive analytics with traditional pharmacy operations enables proactive rather than reactive inventory decisions. Implementation challenges included staff training and initial system calibration, but benefits emerged within 6 months of deployment., Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms significantly enhance pharmaceutical inventory optimization in community pharmacy settings, improving patient access while reducing waste and operational costs.
