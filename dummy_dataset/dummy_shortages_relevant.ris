N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the global insulin shortage on diabetes management patterns and glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 12,456 type 1 diabetic patients from 187 endocrinology clinics across North America between January 2022 and December 2023. The insulin shortage period was defined from March 2023 to September 2023. Primary outcomes included HbA1c levels, frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis episodes, and insulin dosing patterns. Secondary outcomes included emergency department visits and hospitalization rates., RESULTS: During the shortage period, 67.8% of patients experienced changes in their insulin regimen. Mean HbA1c levels increased from 7.2% (95% CI 7.1-7.3) pre-shortage to 8.1% (95% CI 7.9-8.3) during shortage (p<0.001). Diabetic ketoacidosis episodes increased by 45% compared to pre-shortage rates. Alternative insulin formulations were used in 78% of affected patients, with 34% requiring dose adjustments. Geographic variation in shortage impact ranged from 23% to 89% across different regions., CONCLUSION: The insulin shortage significantly impacted glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients, leading to increased complications and healthcare utilization. Robust shortage mitigation strategies are essential for maintaining diabetes care quality. Copyright © 2024 American Diabetes Association.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Oncology drug shortages pose significant challenges to cancer treatment delivery and patient outcomes. Limited research exists on how shortages affect treatment protocols and clinical decision-making., AIMS: We evaluated the impact of chemotherapy drug shortages on treatment modifications, delays, and patient outcomes across multiple cancer centers., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from 45 cancer centers between 2020 and 2022. We analyzed treatment patterns for 8,934 patients receiving chemotherapy during documented shortage periods for carboplatin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess changes in treatment protocols, dosing modifications, and clinical outcomes., RESULTS: Treatment delays occurred in 42.7% of patients during shortage periods compared to 8.9% during non-shortage periods (p<0.0001). Protocol modifications were implemented in 76.3% of cases, including dose reductions (45.2%), alternative drug substitutions (38.9%), and treatment schedule changes (51.7%). Overall survival was not significantly different between shortage and non-shortage periods (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.21, p=0.63), though time to progression increased by 3.2 weeks on average., CONCLUSIONS: Oncology drug shortages necessitate frequent treatment modifications but do not appear to significantly compromise survival outcomes when managed with appropriate clinical protocols. Proactive shortage management strategies are crucial for maintaining treatment quality in oncology practice. Copyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  - Introduction: The widespread amoxicillin shortage in 2023 forced clinicians to use alternative antibiotics, potentially impacting resistance patterns. This study examines changes in antibiotic prescribing and resistance during the shortage period. Objectives: The primary objective was to assess changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns and antimicrobial resistance rates during the amoxicillin shortage. Secondary objectives included evaluation of clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. Methods: This national surveillance study analyzed antibiotic prescribing data from 892 healthcare facilities across the United States from January 2022 to December 2023. Resistance patterns were assessed using National Healthcare Safety Network data. Clinical outcomes and costs were compared between shortage and non-shortage periods. Results: During the amoxicillin shortage, prescriptions for alternative antibiotics increased: azithromycin (+67%), cephalexin (+89%), and clindamycin (+43%). Resistance rates to azithromycin in Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 12.4% to 19.7% (p=0.003). Healthcare costs increased by an average of $340 per patient due to more expensive alternative therapies. Treatment failure rates increased from 4.2% to 7.8% for respiratory tract infections (p<0.001). Length of stay for hospitalized patients increased by 1.3 days on average. Conclusion: The amoxicillin shortage led to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, contributing to rising resistance rates and increased healthcare costs. Strategic antibiotic stewardship during shortages is essential to minimize long-term resistance implications. Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - PURPOSE: Antidepressant shortages can significantly disrupt mental health treatment continuity. This study examined the impact of sertraline and escitalopram shortages on treatment adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder., METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records from 234 psychiatric clinics across Canada from 2021 to 2023. Patients prescribed sertraline or escitalopram during documented shortage periods were included. Primary outcomes included medication adherence, treatment discontinuation rates, and psychiatric hospitalization. Propensity score matching was used to compare outcomes between shortage-exposed and non-exposed patients., RESULTS: Of 15,789 patients analyzed, 9,234 were exposed to antidepressant shortages. Medication adherence decreased from 78.9% to 62.3% during shortage periods (p<0.0001). Treatment discontinuation rates increased by 45% compared to non-shortage periods. Psychiatric hospitalizations increased by 23% in the shortage-exposed group (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.41, p=0.002). Emergency department visits for mental health crises increased by 34%. Switching to alternative antidepressants occurred in 67% of patients, with 28% experiencing withdrawal symptoms during transitions., CONCLUSION: Antidepressant shortages significantly disrupt mental health treatment, leading to decreased adherence and increased healthcare utilization. Mental health systems require robust contingency planning to maintain treatment continuity during medication shortages. Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine shortages pose significant public health risks, particularly for pediatric populations. The 2021-2022 shortage of routine childhood vaccines created challenges for maintaining immunization schedules and population immunity., METHODS: We analyzed immunization coverage data from all 50 US states during the vaccine shortage period (September 2021 to March 2022) compared to the same period in previous years. Outcomes included vaccination completion rates, delayed immunizations, and incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. State-level factors associated with shortage impact were assessed using multivariable regression analysis., RESULTS: National vaccination coverage decreased by 8.9% during the shortage period. Delayed immunizations occurred in 34.7% of scheduled appointments. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine shortages led to a 23% increase in measles susceptibility in children aged 12-15 months. Pertussis incidence increased by 67% in states with the most severe vaccine shortages. Rural areas experienced disproportionately greater impacts, with vaccination delays 2.3 times higher than urban areas. Catch-up vaccination campaigns initiated after shortage resolution achieved 89% recovery of missed doses within 6 months., CONCLUSION: Pediatric vaccine shortages significantly impact immunization coverage and population health outcomes. Strengthened vaccine supply chain management and strategic stockpiling are essential for maintaining childhood immunization programs during shortages. Copyright © 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Emergency departments (EDs) are particularly vulnerable to medication shortages due to the critical nature of care provided. This study examines how drug shortages affect clinical decision-making and patient safety in emergency settings., DESIGN: Prospective observational study conducted across 67 hospital emergency departments in the United States from July 2023 to February 2024., PARTICIPANTS: 23,456 ED patients whose treatment was affected by documented medication shortages during the study period., INTERVENTIONS: Analysis of alternative treatment protocols implemented during shortages of critical emergency medications including epinephrine, midazolam, and norepinephrine., MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes included treatment delays, medication errors, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included ED length of stay, patient satisfaction, and healthcare costs., RESULTS: Medication shortages affected 18.7% of ED patients during the study period. Treatment delays occurred in 34% of affected cases, with an average delay of 47 minutes. Alternative medication protocols were successful in 82% of cases, though 15% required dose adjustments. Medication errors increased by 28% during shortage periods (p=0.008). Patient length of stay increased by an average of 2.1 hours. No significant differences in mortality or major adverse events were observed between shortage and non-shortage periods., CONCLUSIONS: While medication shortages create operational challenges in emergency departments, appropriate alternative protocols can maintain patient safety. However, shortages do increase treatment complexity, delays, and resource utilization in emergency care settings. Copyright © 2024 American College of Emergency Physicians.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure patients require consistent access to evidence-based medications. Drug shortages of key cardiovascular agents can disrupt optimal treatment and potentially worsen outcomes., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker shortages on clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)., METHODS: Registry analysis of 18,967 HFrEF patients from the National Heart Failure Database between 2021 and 2023. Patients were categorized as shortage-exposed or non-exposed based on documented medication availability during their treatment period. Primary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and medication adherence rates., RESULTS: Shortage exposure occurred in 42.3% of patients during the study period. Cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between groups (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94-1.24, p=0.29). However, heart failure hospitalizations increased by 19% in shortage-exposed patients (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.34, p=0.004). Medication adherence decreased from 84.7% to 73.2% during shortage periods (p<0.001). Alternative medication regimens were implemented in 76% of affected patients, with dose optimization achieved in 89% of cases within 3 months. Quality of life scores decreased by an average of 8.3 points during shortage periods., CONCLUSION: While cardiovascular drug shortages do not significantly impact mortality in heart failure patients when managed appropriately, they do increase hospitalizations and reduce medication adherence. Proactive shortage management and patient education are crucial for maintaining optimal heart failure care. Copyright © 2023 European Society of Cardiology.

N2  - Introduction: Anesthesia drug shortages pose unique challenges in surgical settings where immediate medication availability is critical for patient safety. This study examines the impact of propofol and rocuronium shortages on perioperative care and surgical outcomes. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 34,789 surgical cases across 89 hospitals during documented anesthesia drug shortage periods from March 2021 to September 2022. Primary outcomes included anesthesia protocol modifications, surgery delays, and perioperative complications. Secondary outcomes included recovery times, patient satisfaction, and healthcare costs. Results: Anesthesia protocol modifications occurred in 67.8% of cases during shortage periods. Surgery delays affected 23.4% of scheduled procedures, with an average delay of 38 minutes. Alternative anesthetic agents were used successfully in 91% of cases, though 12% required intraoperative adjustments. Perioperative complication rates remained stable (3.2% vs 3.1%, p=0.67). Recovery times increased by an average of 18 minutes when alternative agents were used (p=0.002). Postoperative nausea and vomiting rates increased from 12.4% to 16.7% with alternative protocols (p<0.001). Healthcare costs increased by $127 per case due to more expensive alternative medications. Discussion: Anesthesia drug shortages create operational challenges but do not significantly compromise patient safety when managed with appropriate alternative protocols. However, shortages do impact efficiency, costs, and some quality indicators in surgical care. Conclusion: While anesthesia drug shortages disrupt normal surgical workflows, experienced anesthesia teams can maintain patient safety through protocol adaptations, though at increased cost and complexity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory arthritis require consistent access to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to maintain disease control. Shortages of methotrexate and other key DMARDs can lead to disease flares and joint damage., METHODS: Multi-center cohort study of 7,892 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis from 145 rheumatology clinics during DMARD shortage periods between 2022-2024. Disease activity scores, medication adherence, and clinical outcomes were assessed during shortage and non-shortage periods., RESULTS: DMARD shortages affected 38.6% of patients during the study period. Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28) increased from a mean of 2.8 to 3.6 during shortage periods (p<0.001). Disease flares occurred in 45.3% of shortage-exposed patients compared to 18.7% in non-exposed patients (OR 3.67, 95% CI 3.21-4.20, p<0.001). Alternative DMARD therapies were initiated in 72% of affected patients, with 84% achieving disease control within 12 weeks. Biologic therapy initiation increased by 34% during shortage periods. Healthcare utilization increased significantly, with 67% more unscheduled clinic visits and 23% more emergency department visits. Joint damage progression was observed in 12.4% of patients with prolonged shortage exposure >6 months., CONCLUSION: DMARD shortages significantly impact disease activity and clinical outcomes in inflammatory arthritis patients. Early identification of shortages and rapid implementation of alternative therapies are crucial for preventing disease flares and long-term joint damage.
