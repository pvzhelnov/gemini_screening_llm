N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical supply chains, particularly affecting essential medicine availability in hospital settings across Europe. Objective: To assess the impact of supply chain disruptions on medicine availability and identify factors contributing to stockout events in European hospitals during 2020-2022., Methods: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted across 45 hospitals in 12 European countries. Data on medicine stockouts, procurement delays, and alternative sourcing strategies were collected from hospital pharmacy databases. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and regression modeling to identify predictors of stockout events., Results: A total of 2,847 stockout events were documented across participating hospitals, affecting 892 unique medicines. Critical care medications showed the highest vulnerability with 34% experiencing stockouts lasting more than 7 days. Hospitals with diversified supplier networks showed 28% fewer stockout events compared to those relying on single suppliers. The implementation of strategic reserves reduced stockout duration by an average of 3.2 days., Conclusions: Supply chain diversification and strategic stockpiling significantly improve medicine availability during crisis periods. European hospitals should strengthen procurement resilience through multi-supplier strategies and enhanced inventory management systems.
